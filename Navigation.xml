Navigation.xml

This file contains the structural definition of links and category items for the navigation tree.
The hierarchy of the items inside the Navigation element are to be represented by the system
as a navigation tree.

The navigation tree can be rendered in many ways - that is not encoded in this document. Therefore,
this document can be used to render an expandable/collapsible tree view using JavaScript, or
plain HTML (though multi-frame layouts will need some scripting to open more than one page
with a single click), or any other technology that might render a navigation tree.

This allows us or a customer to change the look-and-feel of the navigation tree on a per-site basis.
Each site will have its own Navigation.xml file, allowing per-site customization of the order or visibility
of the various items in the navigation tree.

The system will check a user's permissions before displaying a link in the navigation tree that is
displayed to the user.


Types of elements:

<Navigation>
    This is the root element - all other items must be contain within this element.
</Navigation>

<InternalLink>
    This defines a custom link to any page within the site. By default, it does not open a new browser.

    The value of primary and secondary targets should include the relative path only (no "http://",
    and no "www.sitename.com"). It should only consist of the script to be run and any values passed.
    For scripting platform independence, the file extension is not required (it will be added by the
    system if not present). Therefore, the following is valid: "page?a=1&amp;b=2".
    Note that ampersands need to be escaped as "&amp;".

    Attributes:
	- primary
	    The primary target of the link. In the no-frame layout, this is the only link that will be opened.
	    In the multi-frame layout, this target will be opened in the frame referred to by the 'frame'
	    attribute. (required)
	- secondary
	    A secondary link target. In the multi-frame layout, this is the page that will be loaded
	    in the frame not referred to in the 'frame' attribute. Will not be loaded in the no-frame layout.
	    (optional - when not present, the frame not referred to by 'frame' will remain as is)
	- frame
	    What frame to load the primary target into. Can be"upper", "lower", or "replace". The
	    "replace" value will abandon the frame-set and load the primary target directly in the
	    browser - this is mainly useful in the "logout" link. (optional; defaults to "upper")
	- expand
	    Used in multi-frame layouts only. Can be either "upper", "lower", or "both". (optional;
	    defaults to "both")
	- phrase
	    The phrase that should be displayed in the link. (required)
	- newbrowser
	    If "true", the link will open a new browser. (optional; defaults to "false")
</InternalLink>

<ExternalLink>
    This defines a link to anywhere on the Web. Opens a new browser by default.
    The target value must include the site name ("www.sitename.com") but the protocol
    is optional; it defaults to "http://".

    Attributes:
	- target
	    The target of the link.
	- phrase
	    The phrase that should be displayed in the link.
</ExternalLink>

<ModuleLink>
    This is a shorter and more concise way of defining an internal link to a module.
    It takes the module ID of a module and uses it to create the proper links. By
    default, it will open the module's Search screen in the upper frame and the
    List screen in the lower frame. In a non-frame layout, the List screen is displayed.

    Attributes:
	- moduleID
	    The module ID code for the module. (required)
	- phrase
	    The phrase to be displayed in the link. (optional - will use moduleID to look up the
	    name of the module if not present)
</ModuleLink>

<Category>
    This is a non-link item, that serves to group a number of other items.

    Attributes:
	- phrase
	    The phrase that should be displayed. (required)
</Category>

Any of these elements can take any number of sub-elements, which means that the sub-elments
will be displayed one level deeper in the hierarchy, below the containing elements.
