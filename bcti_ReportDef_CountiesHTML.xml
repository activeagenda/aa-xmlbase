            ReportLocation determines which reports screen the report will be listed in. Level can be either "Record" or "List". If the report should be visible in both the record-level and list-level screens, simply add a ReportLocation element for each.
            
            The group attribute can be any sensible group name, and will determine the header on the report view screen under whic a particular report will be sorted. Until I think of something better, reports will appear in alpha order on the page.
